This case study concerns the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN

We consider the scenario where two stations trying to send packets simultaneously.

The PRISM model is taken from [KNS02a] using the integer semantics given in [KNS06]. In the model one time unit
corresponds to 50μs and to ensure integer bounds, where neccessary, scaling lower bound constraints down and
upper bound constraints up to sensure a sound abstraction.

PARAMETERS

wlanK.nm - K is the maximum value of a stations backoff counter where 6 is specified in the standard
TRANS_TIME_MAX - maximum time to send a packet where (after scaling) 315 specified in the standard
COL=2: in collosion model to count number collisions (parameter k in the property files must be less than or equal to COL)
DEADLINE: in time_bounded model is the deadline
