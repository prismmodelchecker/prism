// Theorem 1 (mutual exclusion)

filter(forall, num_crit <= 1)

// Lemma C
// If the crical section is occupied then eventually it becomes clear

filter(forall, num_crit > 0 => P>=1 [ F num_crit = 0 ])

// Lemma D
// If a process is between 4 and 13 (in our version) then eventually some process gets to 14

// Theorem 2 (liveness)
// If process 1 tries then eventually it enters the critical section
