Revision: Version 2.0.2
Turin, Italy, February 01, 2004

dddmp-2.0.2 is now available at
WEB page: http://staff.polito.it/{gianpiero.cabodi,stefano.quer}
dddmp-2.0.2 has a few bug fixes with respect to dddmp-2.0
   
Release 2.0.2 of DDDMP improves DDDMP-1.2 in the following areas:
 
  1. Support to store and load ADD has been inserted in the dddmp tool

  2. Support to store BDDs as CNF formulas has been inserted in the
     dddmp tool.
     As far as the storing process is concerned three possible formats
     are available:

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_NODE
       store a BDD by introducing an auxiliary variable for each BDD node

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_MAXTERM
       store a BDD by following the maxterm of the represented function

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_BEST
       trade-of between the two previous solution, trying to optimize
       the number of literals stored.
     
     As far as the loading process is concerned three possible formats
     are available:

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_NO_CONJ
       Return the Clauses without Conjunction

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_NO_QUANT
       Return the sets of BDDs without Quantification

     DDDMP_CNF_MODE_CONJ_QUANT
       Return the sets of BDDs AFTER Existential Quantification

  3. Functions to load the header of a BDD/ADD/CNF file, so collecting
     information regarding variables, variable ordering, etc.
     This can be seen as a pre-processing step prior a possible BDD/ADD/CNF
     load of the entire structure.
     Moreover it can be used in a manager initialization phase.

  4. More precise information are stored in each BDD/ADD header during
     the storing phase.
     In particular this information may be used to make up the exact
     variable ordering present in the manager used during the storing
     phase.
     Full compatibility with previously versions of the files (from
     dddmp-1.0 on) is guaranteed.

  5. Miscellaneous
     Debugging has been performed on different hardware architectures

  6. The test program, testdddmp has been improved.
     Now it allows to perform more operations and to better debug the
     different options.
