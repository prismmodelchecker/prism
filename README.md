# PRISM

This is PRISM (Probabilistic Symbolic Model Checker).

This extension includes the implementations and experimental results for the work “Approximating the Upper Bound of Interval Iteration for Probabilistic Model Checking” proposed by Mohammadsadegh Mohagheghi and Khayyam Salehi.

Experimental results of the proposed work are located in the "prism/experiments" folder.
Results for the training step are located in the "prism/experiments/training" folder. This folder also contains the results of applying regression on the training data, proposed in the 'regression.ods' file.



## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, check the online manual at:

  http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/InstallingPRISM/Instructions
  
or see the local copy included in this distribution:

 * `manual/InstallingPRISM/Instructions.html`

Very abbreviated instructions for installing/running PRISM are as follows:

For Windows binary distributions:

 * to install, run `prism-XXX-win-installer.exe`
 * to run, use Desktop/Start menu shortcuts or double-click `bin\xprism.bat`

For other binary distributions:

 * to install, enter the PRISM directory and type `./install.sh`
 * to run, execute `bin/xprism` or `bin/prism`

For source code distributions:

 * enter the PRISM directory and type `cd prism` then `make`
 * to check the install, type `make test`
 * to run, execute `bin/xprism` or `bin/prism`

If you have problems check the manual, especially the section "Common Problems And Questions".
