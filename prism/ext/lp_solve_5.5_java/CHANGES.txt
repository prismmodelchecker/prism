This file contains the version history of the lp_solve Java wrapper.
The wrapper has no version numbering of its own but follows the
version scheme of lp_solve.

5.5.0.14
--------
- The build scripts now also generate 64 bit versions in win64 or ux64 directories.
- build scripts added for unix and tested on unix
- lpsolve5j.cpp gave some warning about delete on void pointer. Modified.

5.5.0.11
--------
- New API resizeLp for lp_solve 5.5.0.11 added

5.5.0.9 (07.09.2006)
--------------------
- Revised unittest program because it gave some errors and warnings that it shouldn't give.


5.5.0.8 (27.08.2006)
--------------------
- New API guessBasis for lp_solve 5.5.0.8 added


5.5.0.2 beta (26.06.2005)
--------------------
- New API constants for lp_solve 5.5.0.2 added
- New test cases


5.5.0.0 beta (23.05.2005)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.5.0.0 implemented
- lp_solve 5.5.0.0 is still beta, so there are known bugs that also
  show up in the Java wrapper
- Some unit tests are missing for new API functions so the wrapper code
  is to some extent untested.


5.1.1.3 (17.03.2005)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.1.1.3 implemented (read_basis, write_basis)
- Relaxed JNI Version requirement to 1.2 in order to support also JDK 1.3
- Tested also with JDK 1.5 (5.0): runs without changes on new Java version
- Java classes are now precompiled with JDK 1.5, but with 1.4 as target
  platform to ensure backward compatibility


5.1.1.2 (05.01.2005)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.1.1.1 implemented (no changes for 5.1.1.2).
- Removed some constants which are only internally used from LpSolve class.


5.1.1.0 (01.12.2004)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.1.1.0 implemented (only two constants added).
- Class files in demo directory are now packed in jar archives.
- Updated build file for Mac OS X from Sean P. Kane.


5.1.0.2 (21.09.2004)
--------------------
- Added a build file to compile the stub library on Mac OS X.
  Thanks to Sean P. Kane who provided this script.


5.1.0.1 (12.09.2004)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.1.0.1 implemented (only two constants added).
- Added a description how to call lp_solve functions from Python/Jython
  to README.html and a Python demo program to the demo directory.
- Tests for set_column(ex) and set_row enabled again


5.1.0.0 (08.09.2004)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.1.0.0 implemented.
- Wrapper libraries renamed to lpsolve51j.dll (liblpsolve51.so for Linux)
  and lpsolve51.jar to keep in sync with the naming conventions of
  the core lp_solve distribution.
- Tests for set_row(ex) and set_column(ex) temporarily disabled until
  issue is resolved in lp_solve
- Demo program now shows the use of callback functions.
- writeLp, writeMps, writeFreeMps and writeXLI and their read* equivalents
  now accept filenames with native (non UTF-8) characters.
- Resetting the callback functions to default values did not work
  correctly. Fixed.


5.0.10.0 (24.07.2004)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.0.10.0 implemented.
- Added more test cases.
- Some changes in doc file README.html


5.0.9.0 (22.06.2004)
--------------------
- API changes for lp_solve 5.0.9.0 implemented, including new XLI functions.
- getUpbo and getLowbo were not implemented correctly. Fixed.
- The methods in the listener interfaces for the lp_solve callback functions
  are now declared to throw an LpSolveException to allow implementing classes
  to throw such an exception.
- Added more test cases.
- Added junit.jar and batch/shell scripts to run the JUnit testcases on
  Windows and Linux.


5.0.8.1 (14.06.2004)
--------------------
- Moved lpsolve5j.dll from lib to lib\win32 and added a build script for
  Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
- Added a Linux shared library and gcc build script to lib\linux.
- Minor C source modifications to make it compile on Linux.
- Documentation modifications for Linux lib.
- The following lp_solve functions were not implemented in the wrapper:
  get_ptr_dual_solution, get_ptr_sensitivity_obj, get_ptr_sensitivity_rhs,
  is_constr_type, is_piv_rule, print_str. Fixed.
- Changed setPreferduals (Java) parameter type from int to boolean.
- The names of the methods getLambda and getPtrLambda were reversed. Fixed.
- Changed getRow and getColumn which now exctly follow the lp_solve API
  and return their results in an array which must be allocated by the caller.
- Added the methods getPtrRow and getPtrColumn (which are not in lp_solve) for
  convenience. Their return value is an array allocated by the method.
- Added more test cases.


5.0.8.0 (06.06.2004)
--------------------
- To avoid confusion with the lp_solve version numbering and in order to be
  consistent with the naming conventions of the other interface libraries,
  the lpsolve4j software has been renamed. The distribution archive is now
  called lp_solve_5.0_java.zip. The libraries have been renamed to lpsolve5j.dll
  and lpsolve5j.jar. The package name of the LpSolve class has been renamed
  from lpsolve4j to lpsolve. Documentation has been updated to avoid the usage
  of lpsolve4j completely.
- Implementation of API changes from lp_solve 5.0.7.0 and 5.0.8.0
- Added file CHANGES.txt in docs directory for version history
- Source files are now compiled with the header files from lp_solve5.zip
  instead of using the sources.


5.0.6.0 (27.05.2004)
--------------------
- Implementation of API changes from lp_solve 5.0.6.0
