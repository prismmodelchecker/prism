This file contains details of the changes in each new version of PRISM.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since version 4.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Default location of the XPRISM settings file has changed,
  to avoid cluttering the user's home directory:
  - On Linux (adhering to XDG Base Directory Specification):
     $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/prism.settings  (if that environment variable is set)
     $HOME/.config/prism.settings     (otherwise)
  - On macOS:
     $HOME/Library/Preferences/prism.settings
  - On Windows:
     .prism in the user's home directory (unchanged from previous location)

  If the settings file already exists in the legacy location
     $HOME/.prism
  XPRISM continues to use that location.
